# GUI
Saloon Appointment System: This project aims to develop an effective salon management system to streamline appointment scheduling, manage staff and services, and track business performance. The backend will be built using C# with Entity Framework Core to handle database interactions, while the frontend will use React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly interface. A shared database will store customer, appointment, and service information, ensuring real-time synchronization across all platforms. The application will enable users to perform essential CRUD operations for managing appointments, staff schedules, and service offerings, providing a seamless experience for both customers and administrators.
